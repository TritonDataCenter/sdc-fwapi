# FWAPI (Firewall API)

This is the reference documentation for FWAPI, the Firewall API for
SmartDataCenter (SDC).

# Overview

## Design principles

The FWAPI design principles are:

* It should be easy to manage rules for large numbers of machines easily -
  you should never have to manage the same rule for a number of machines.
* Managing these rules should be made easier using the VM's metadata
  (eg: tags)
* The firewall should live outside of the VM: it should be as if the VM is
  connected to its own physical firewall sitting between it and the rest of
  the world.
* Updating firewall rules should happen out of band - it should be
  impossible to lock out whatever's doing the updating.
* Updates should happen as instantaneously as possible, and should not
  require rebooting of the VM.

For more information about the implementation and various pieces of the
firewalling system, consult the
[architecture and troubleshooting guide](architecture.html).

See also the [examples](examples.html) for some common use-cases.

## Default Policy

The default policy for a VM with its firewall enabled is:

* block all inbound traffic
* allow all outbound traffic

This default policy cannot be changed - you must add rules that get applied
in addition to these defaults.

## Rules

Important things to remember:

* Rules are not necessarily per instance.
* Rather, one rule can affect many VMs through the **tags** or **all vms**
  targets.
* All user rules are tied to that users' owner_uuid, which restricts the
  rules to VMs that they own.
* The exception is global rules - these are set by the administrator, and
  will apply to all VMs in the datacenter (not just for a particular owner).
  There is currently only one of these enabled by default, which allows
  pings from any host.
* Rules can be individually enabled or disabled.

In the case of two rules that affect the same VM and port, the rule that
goes counter to the default policy takes precedence.  This means:

* If you have an incoming BLOCK and an incoming ALLOW rule for the
  same VM and port, the ALLOW will override.
* If you have an outgoing BLOCK and an outgoing ALLOW rule for the
  same VM and port, the BLOCK will override.

## VMs

Important things to remember:

* Firewall rules only affect a VM if it has the **firewall_enabled**
  property set to **true**.
* Updating tags on the VMs will affect what rules are applied to the VM.
* FWAPI firewall rules only work on **KVM** VMs running on server platform_version newer than **20140314**.
* FWAPI firewall rules work on all SmartOS VMs.

## An Example

Say you are running a website - you have a number of web servers that make
connections to a number of database servers.  You want the following
firewall behaviour:

* Anyone on the internet can speak HTTP and HTTPS to the webservers
* Webservers *only* can speak to the database servers on the database port
* Webservers and database servers can SSH to each other

To implement this in FWAPI, you would first add three rules:

**"Anyone on the internet can speak HTTP and HTTPS to the webservers":**

    FROM any TO tag www ALLOW tcp (port 80 and port 443)

**"Webservers *only* can speak to the database servers on the database port":**

    FROM tag www TO tag db ALLOW tcp port 5432

**"Webservers and database servers can SSH to each other":**

    FROM all vms to all vms ALLOW tcp port 22

"all vms" here means "all VM instances that are owned by that user"

There are two more steps necessary:

* Updating all webserver VMs with tag **www**
* Updating all database VMs with tag **db**

Please see the [CloudAPI Guide](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-cloudapi/blob/master/docs/index.md#firewallrules)
for more examples.

# Rule Syntax

Rules are written in a Doman Specific Language (DSL). References for the rule syntax
can be found in:

* [Rule Syntax Guide](rules.html)
* [Cloud Firewall Rules Reference](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/public-cloud/network/firewall/cloud-firewall-rules-reference)
* [CloudAPI Guide - Firewall Rules](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-cloudapi/blob/master/docs/index.md#firewallrules)

# Rules

These endpoints manage firewall rules.

## ListRules (GET /rules)

Returns a list of all rules.

### Inputs

All inputs are optional.  Fields with *Filter* in the description will filter
the rules returned.  They will match rules with these targets in either the
FROM or TO side of the rule.

| Field      | Type             | Description                    |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| fields     | Array of Strings | List of extra fields to return |
| ip         | String           | Filter: IP                     |
| owner_uuid | UUID             | Filter: Owner UUID             |
| protocol   | String           | Filter: Protocol (e.g., "tcp") |
| subnet     | String           | Filter: Subnet CIDR            |
| tag        | String           | Filter: Tag                    |
| vm         | UUID             | Filter: VM UUID                |

The `fields` parameter controls additional fields that will be returned.
Valid fields are:

| Field           | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| parsed.action   | The rule's action: `block` or `allow` (in the `parsed` object) |
| parsed.ports    | Ports the rule affects (in the `parsed` object)                |
| parsed.protocol | Rule protocol (in the `parsed` object)                         |
| parsed.tags     | Rule tags (in the `parsed` object)                             |

# Resolve

This is an internal API endpoint used by the firewaller agent to fetch
rules from the API.  **Its interface is unstable and for internal use only.**

## Resolve (POST /resolve)

This endpoint is used by the firewaller agent to fetch rules and assist with
determining which remote VMs need to be transfered to a Compute Node.  It is
intended to resolve the following information:

For a given set of VMs that have a certain set of tags,

* What firewall rules apply to those VMs?
* What data do I need to request from VMAPI to retrieve VMs on other Compute
  Nodes that are targets of those rules?

### Inputs

| Field      | Type           | Description                          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| owner_uuid | UUID           | Owner UUID of the rule (required)    |
| vms        | Array of UUIDs | VM UUIDs to query (optional)         |
| tags       | Object         | Tag key / values to query (optional) |

### Example: get the rules that apply to VM 2ca7d243-215f-41d7-a8ed-c83e4712a8bf

    POST /resolve -d '

      "owner_uuid": "98c2d1f4-66f4-468c-97ff-4b19c5d9ab22"
    }

In the response above:

* *rules* is the list of rules that apply to that set of VMs and tags.
* *tags* is a mapping of tag key / values to retrieve.  If a key is set to true,
  all VMs that have a tag with that name need to be retrieved, regardless of
  the tag's value. If set to an array of values, tags with that name and
  the values in the array need to be retrieved.
* *vms* is a list of VM UUIDs to retrieve.
* *allVMs* indicates that all VMs from this owner need to be retrieved.

Note that the values returned effectively form an OR query, so for the example
above, we need to retrieve VMs with (tag role = db) OR (role = www) OR (tag
something).
